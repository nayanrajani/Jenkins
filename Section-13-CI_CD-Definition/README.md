- CI/CD is nothing else but a methodology/strategy to deploy code faster to production!

- Thinks that you have an app and you want to deploy it to prod. What should you do? Well you should do a lot manual things, like testing it yourself, compiling, deploying, etc. All of this is normally done manually by a human who can make mistakes! And probably that guy will be awake at 2 am deploying to prod. Trust me, I've lived it.

- So, how does CI/CD help?

- Well, you will define an entire workflow that will build, test and deploy automatically for you! Isn't cool?

- The process is defined by some steps, starting at CI which is Continuous Integration, where you build an test your code; optionally, you could pass to Continuous Delivery, which deploys your built and tested app to a dev/stg/qa env (just to test again) and finally you deploy to production!

## What is Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment?

- Continuous integration is a software development method where members of the team can integrate their work at least once a day. In this method, every integration is checked by an automated build to search the error.

- Continuous delivery is a software engineering method in which a team develops software products in a short cycle. It ensures that software can be easily released at any time.

- Continuous deployment is a software engineering process in which product functionalities are delivered using automatic deployment. It helps testers to validate whether the codebase changes are correct, and it is stable or not.
